# Project Design Principles

## **1. Efficiency**
- **Lazy Loading**: Resources (e.g., query handlers) are created only when needed, minimizing unnecessary initialization and resource consumption.
- **Caching**: Prevents redundant object creation, ensuring efficient memory and CPU usage.

## **2. Clean & Elegant Design**
- **One-Liner API**: Using the `Section` enum for direct access to query handlers simplifies client code and reduces verbosity.
- **Encapsulation**: Responsibilities are well-distributed across enums, factories, and handlers, keeping each class focused and clear.

## **3. Type and Thread Safety**
- **Generics**: Avoid runtime type casting and ensure compile-time safety.
- **Thread-Safe Initialization**: Double-checked locking guarantees safe access to lazily initialized handlers in multi-threaded environments.

## **4. Flexible & Extensible Design**
- **Enum-Centric Design**: New sections or query handlers can be added simply by updating the `Section` enum and its associated factory logic.
- **Abstract Factory Pattern**: The factory abstraction allows for seamless introduction of new storage backends (e.g., database, JSON) or resource types.

## **5. Best Practices**
- **Separation of Concerns**: Different concerns (e.g., resource handling, query handler creation) are handled by dedicated classes.
- **Scalability**: The design is prepared for future needs, such as adding new query handlers, resource types, or storage backends, without breaking existing code.
- **Consistency**: Naming conventions, method signatures, and architecture are cohesive and easy to follow.
