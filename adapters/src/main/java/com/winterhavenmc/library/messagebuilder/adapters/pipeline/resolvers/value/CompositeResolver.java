/**
 * A {@link ValueResolver} implementation that handles complex or structured objects
 * by applying one or more matching {@link Accessor} instances.
 * <p>
 * The {@code CompositeResolver} delegates the resolution process to registered
 * adapters that know how to transform an object into a set of string values,
 * each of which is mapped to a derived {@link ValidMacroKey}. The resolved entries
 * typically include sub-keys that extend the base string in a dot-notated form.
 * <p>
 * This resolver does not overwrite existing entries in the base string when used
 * in conjunction with a {@link MacroValueResolver}; it merely returns all extracted
 * string-value pairs. The calling resolver is responsible for deciding merge behavior.
 *
 * <p>Example flow:
 * <ol>
 *   <li>Retrieve the object from the {@link MacroObjectMap} using the given {@code macroKey}.</li>
 *   <li>Find all matching adapters for the object via the {@link FieldAccessorRegistry}.</li>
 *   <li>For each adapter, adapt the object and extract string-value mappings via the {@link MacroFieldAccessor}.</li>
 *   <li>Aggregate all mappings into a {@link MacroStringMap}.</li>
 * </ol>
