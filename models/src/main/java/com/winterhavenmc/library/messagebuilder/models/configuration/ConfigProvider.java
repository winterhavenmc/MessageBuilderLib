/**
 * Represents a functional interface for retrieving dynamic configuration values.
 * <p>
 * A {@code ConfigProvider} wraps a {@link java.util.function.Supplier Supplier}, enabling
 * deferred and always up-to-date access to individual settings defined in the pluginâ€™s
 * {@code config.yml} file.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Typical usage includes injecting implementations such as {@code LanguageProvider}
 * or {@code LocaleProvider} into dependent classes that require access to language
 * tags, locales, or other server-defined options.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * This abstraction decouples configuration access from implementation details,
 * promoting testability and runtime flexibility.
 * </p>
 *
 * @param <T> the type of the configuration value provided
