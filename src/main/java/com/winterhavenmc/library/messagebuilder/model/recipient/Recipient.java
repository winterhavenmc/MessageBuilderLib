/**
 * A sealed interface and its related types that represent different categories
 * of message recipients in a player message context.
 * <p>
 * This model encapsulates information about the origin of a command or message
 * recipient and classifies it into one of three known types:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link Recipient.Valid} – A recognized sender type capable of receiving messages directly
 *       (e.g., {@link org.bukkit.entity.Player}, {@link org.bukkit.command.ConsoleCommandSender})</li>
 *   <li>{@link Recipient.Proxied} – A special wrapper for {@link org.bukkit.command.ProxiedCommandSender}
 *       that maintains both the proxied and originating sender</li>
 *   <li>{@link Recipient.Invalid} – An unrecognized or {@code null} sender, with an accompanying reason</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>This design follows a data-driven pattern: recipients are validated and categorized
 * during construction via the static factory method {@link #of(CommandSender)}, which guarantees
 * type safety and clarity at the call site.
 *
 * <p>Typical usage:
 * <pre>{@code
 * Recipient recipient = Recipient.of(sender);
 *
 * if (recipient instanceof Recipient.Sendable sendable) {
 *     sendable.sender().sendMessage("Hello!");
 * }
 * }</pre>
 *
 * @see Recipient.Sendable
 * @see Recipient.Valid
 * @see Recipient.Proxied
 * @see Recipient.Invalid
 * @see Recipient.InvalidReason
