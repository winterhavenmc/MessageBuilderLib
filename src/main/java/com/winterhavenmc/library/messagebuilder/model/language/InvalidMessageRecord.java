/**
 * A {@link MessageRecord} representing a missing or invalid entry from the
 * {@code MESSAGES} section of a language file.
 * <p>
 * This class is returned by the
 * {@code MessageRecord.from(LegacyRecordKey, ConfigurationSection)}
 * factory method when the provided section is {@code null}, or when a parsing error occurs.
 * <p>
 * The {@code reason} field provides a human-readable explanation for why the record is considered invalid.
 * This allows for safe logging, debugging, and non-fatal fallback behavior in the library's message pipeline.
 *
 * <p>Invalid message records are safe to pass around and will typically result in no message
 * being rendered or sent when encountered.
