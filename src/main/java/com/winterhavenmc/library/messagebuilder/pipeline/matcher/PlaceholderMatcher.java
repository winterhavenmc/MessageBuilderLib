 * Default implementation of the {@link Matcher} interface that uses Javaâ€™s built-in
 * {@link java.util.regex.Pattern} and {@link java.util.regex.MatchResult} APIs to extract
 * macro keys from an input string.

 * <p>This class transforms matching groups into {@link ValidMacroKey}
 * instances using {@code LegacyMacroKey.of(...)}, and silently skips any invalid results.
 *
 * <p>It is designed for use in both the resolution and replacement stages of the pipeline,
 * depending on whether base keys or full macro keys are being matched.
